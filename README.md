# 🏃‍♂️ Startpress
A tool to quickly setup an Express TypeScript REST API project built using C#.

This project was something I personally used for a while, it worked so well that I decided to rebuild it but make it open source.

## Technologies
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

That's basically it. In my opinion, C# is the most practical language ever made. That's why I 💖 it, and that's why many people do so as well. 

## Installation
Currently, the project isn't available for installation officially. But, there will be alpha and beta releases found in the [Releases](//github.com/atomisadev/startpress/releases) page.
